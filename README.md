<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Overview

In this project, I will examine salaries and its relationship to player performance in Major League Soccer, the First Division professional soccer league in the United States.

### Purpose

As an avid soccer fan, soccer referee, and frequent attendee of Nashville SC (and previously Chicago Fire FC) matches, I am interested to discover how different clubs managed their finances and how that correlated to their success on the field. Additionally, because this data is slightly old, I want to see if I can predict future salaries of players in today's growing league.

### Goal of this Project

Perform a detailed analysis and modelling of the dataset. I want to take an idea I have, plan its implementation, get data, work with it and bring the project to completion.
