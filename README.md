## About The Project

### Overview

In this project, I examine salaries and its relationship to player performance in Major League Soccer, the First Division professional soccer league in the United States.

### Purpose

As an avid soccer fan, soccer referee, and frequent attendee of Nashville SC (and previously Chicago Fire FC) matches, I was interested to discover how different clubs managed their finances and how that correlated to their success on the field. Additionally, I wanted to see if I could create a basic model that could accurately predict player salaries given performance statistics.

### Goal of this Project

Perform a detailed analysis and modelling of the dataset. I wanted to take an idea I had, plan its implementation, get data, work with it and bring the project to completion.

## Roadmap

1. Finding and Importing Data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Salary Prediction
